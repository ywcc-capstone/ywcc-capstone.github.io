# Capstone Project Tracks
Within YWCC, there are hundreds of students across 9 different majors. Most are in Computer Science or Information Technology programs, but we offer many different tracks for those students who are in the other major programs as well.

## Software/Hardware Projects

2. Student Startups

## Real-World Connections
Do you want to inspire the next generation of software developers and digital creatives? In this track, you come up with your own curriculum to teach middle- and high-school students topics such as:
* Web Development
* Game Design
* Filmmaking and Video Editing
* Digital Marketing
* and more!


## CISCO Academy
The CISCO track is geared towards Network and Information Security students looking to take their practical skills and abilities to the next level. CISCO track applicants must first take a qualifier exam on networking concepts and ideas (double check with Dr. Eljabiri on this one, as we skipped the qualifier exam this semester due to low CISCO-track participation).

Once students are selected into the CISCO track, their responsibilities over the semester are two-fold. First, they will attend weekly sessions of CISCO academy courses taught by a CISCO certified instructor, gaining first-hand experience creating and configuring enterprise-level connectivity solutions while learning and being tested on the fundamentals of networking; this all culminates in the taking of the CISCO CCNA 200-301 Certification Exam, where upon passing students will receive the certificate signed by the CEO of CISCO, and for advanced performers, a recommendation letter from the CEO himself.

Secondly, CISCO track students are responsible for a semester-long networking project to be completed with a team of up to 4 members each. Over the semester, CISCO student teams will plan and implement a real-world scenario networking solution of their own design, functioning very similarly to Industry and Startup teams by electing a Project Manager, operating under Agile development principles, and reporting to an Executive Team mentor. CISCO student teams will be responsible for both midterm and Final Showcase presentations, as well as a final paper that describes in detail both the design process and the specific networking concepts utilized in for their project.

Both CISCO Academy and group project experiences will give students a comprehensive understanding of enterprise-level network design, security, and scalability that will prove invaluable upon their entry into the workforce.


## Executive Board
Making sure every student has a successful Capstone experience requires lots of preparation and planning. The Executive Team is responsible for acting as a point-of-contact for students and sponsors as well as orchestrating events such as the Open House, Open University tech talks, and Project Showcases.

As a team, you are expected to:
* Plan events (book rooms, attract media, post announcements, etc.)
* Manage online communication (Canvas, Discord, and the website)
* Respond timely to questions from students, sponsors
* Mentor PMs and meet weekly to ensure progress
