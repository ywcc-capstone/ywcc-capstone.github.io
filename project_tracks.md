# Capstone Project Tracks
Within YWCC, there are hundreds of students across 9 different majors. Most are in Computer Science or Information Technology programs, but we offer many different tracks for those students who are in the other major programs as well.

2. Student Startups

## Real-World Connections
Do you want to inspire the next generation of software developers and digital creatives? In this track, you come up with your own curriculum to teach middle- and high-school students topics such as:
* Web Development
* Game Design
* Filmmaking and Video Editing
* Digital Marketing
* and more!


## CISCO Academy
Required for IT students in the Network and Information Security specialization. 

The CISCO Academy is a set of courses that lead to earning the Cisco Certified Network Association 200-301 Certificate
The primary objective of the Cisco Project of Projects is to study for the Cisco Certified
Network Associate (CCNA) 200-301 certificate as an independent student-led group of
Information Technology students who are the Network and Information Security
specialization through means of group study and projects. Taking the CCNA 200-301 is
optional and independent of the course or NJIT. Students will apply the knowledge they
learned into a single networking project/demonstration in groups of no more than 4
people. The independent networking project will apply all problem-solving strategies &
life cycles in the capstone industry projects and submit the same deliverables. Ideally,
students will emerge from this Capstone project with their CCNA 200-301 and a
technical networking project to add on their resume. Combined with the degree they are
soon to be finishing, students who participate will have the upper hand when entering
the workforce.


## Executive Board
Making sure every student has a successful Capstone experience requires lots of preparation and planning. The Executive Team is responsible for acting as a point-of-contact for students and sponsors as well as orchestrating events such as the Open House, Open University tech talks, and Project Showcases.

As a team, you are expected to:
* Plan events (book rooms, attract media, post announcements, etc.)
* Manage online communication (Canvas, Discord, and the website)
* Respond timely to questions from students, sponsors
* Mentor PMs and meet weekly to ensure progress
