# Welcome
Here, YWCC students take what they've learned from their years at NJIT and put
it to practice in a project-based learning experience.

Students can pick one of many project tracks, including:

1. Industry-Sponsored Projects. A software and/or hardware project, where
   students work closely with company sponsors to solve real business problems.
2. Student Startups. A software and/or hardware project, pioneered and led by
   students.
3. Real-World Connections. A coaching track focused on K-12 students.
4. CISCO Academy. A networking project focused for IT students with an emphasis
   on completing the CCNA exam.
5. The Executive Board. A managerial project, focused on running, improving, and
   developing the Capstone as a whole.
