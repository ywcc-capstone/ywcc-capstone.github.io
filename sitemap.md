<!-- 
    As a general guideline, it's best to adopt a docs-as-code philosophy.
    Most students in the course can write code, so it should fall naturally.
    There are many open-source and freely available tools to make these 
    processes automated and published (such as GitHub pages and CI/CD)t.
