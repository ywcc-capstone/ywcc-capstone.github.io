Welcome, to the YWCC Capstone webpage. Here, YWCC students take what they've learned from their years at NJIT and put it to practice.

Students can pick one of many project tracks, including:
1. Real-World Connections. A coaching track focused on K-12 students.
2. CISCO Academy. A networking project focused for IT students with an emphasis on completing the CCNA exam.
3. Student Startups. A software and/or hardware project, pioneered and led by students.
4. (*) Industry-Sponsored Projects. A software and/or hardware project, where students work closely with company sponsors to solve real business problems.
5. The Executive Board. A managerial project, focused on running, improving, and developing the Capstone as a whole.
