## Course Information

### Course Number, Title, and Credits
CS 491 or IT 491, Senior Capstone Project, 3 credits.

### Prerequisites
Senior standing. An opportunity for students to integrate the knowledge and
skills gained in previous information technology work into a real world
team-based project. The project involves investigation of current literature as
well as implementation of either a part of a large application or the whole of a
small system.


### Course Description
The CS/IT Capstone Project is intended to provide a real-world project-based
learning experience for seniors in the computer science undergraduate degree.
The overall objectives of this course are to investigate the nature and
techniques of a business and computing development project. Projects are either
provided by industry partners or proposed  by  students  who  wish  to  become
entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurship  projects  (E-teams)  are  intended  to build a
foundation for real world businesses. E-teams’ project proposals are reviewed by
course leadership prior to approval. E-teams are mentored and evaluated by an
entrepreneurship board of industry, university and alumni advisors.  E-teams
will  carry  out  market  research,  target  real  world  stakeholders  and
validate  solutions  using quantitative analysis based on customers’ feedback
via questionnaires. The course involves business analysis, business modeling,
project management, feasibility analysis, risk analysis, R&D, requirements
engineering, system design, implementation, quality assurance, documentation and
presentation of a real world business problem and solution. The course is
interdisciplinary in nature where students use their collective knowledge in
business and technology to provide creative solutions in collaboration with real
world project stakeholders. 

## Course Features and Objectives
This course has unique features that are not currently offered through any other
course on campus. 

### Features
* It provides hands-on multidisciplinary real world experiences that integrate
business applications with information technology areas such as multimedia and
network security.
* It strengthens the 4-year college curriculum by enabling students to use what
they learn collectively and creatively.
* It simulates the real-world environment internally in the structure of
students’ teams and course “virtual organization”.
* It offers dynamic market-driven training that reflects hot topics highly
demanded by industry but not usually covered through a static college
curriculum.
* It enables students to master career-oriented skills such as leadership,
presentation, entrepreneurship, social and communication skills.
* It shows how both IT and business knowledge are used to solve real-world IT
  problems.
* The experience gained working on such projects will make students more
employable by industry including the ability of building businesses through the
entrepreneurship track.

### Specific goals for the course
* Ability to breakdown complex problems into manageable pieces (using WBS and
  Gantt).
* Ability to identify project risks and suggest strategies to minimize them.
* Ability to define project stakeholders, scope & requirements (including the
  use of FDD).
* Ability to capture, map and visualize the design of the proposed solution
identifying key components and their relationships (examples: class diagram,
ERM, network diagram, system architecture, etc.)
* Ability to implement the solution successfully using software and/or hardware
technologies or other project related tools (via prototypes).
* Ability to test (validate and verify) the quality of the executed solution
using user feedback and other testing techniques.
* Ability to communicate a value proposition of the project to various
stakeholders including the ability to explain, convince, engage and impress.
* Ability to organize the presentation in a meaningful and professional fashion
including mastering personal and collaboration presentation skills.

### Outcomes
* An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the
  discipline
* An ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing
  requirements appropriate to its solution
* An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system,
  process, component, or program to meet desired needs
* An ability to function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal
* An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues
  and responsibilities 
* An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
* Recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in continuing
  professional development 
* An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for
  computing practice.
* An ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of
  software systems of varying complexity.

### Number of hours of lecture, recitation, and laboratory
Students work on real-world entrepreneurial, industry sponsored or research
development projects for the entire 9 weeks of the semester. The problem-solving
process is broken down into five “Sprints”. A sprint is a 2-3 week time-boxed
duration or project phase that allows students and project‘s stakeholders to
manage change, risk and complexity and adapt to skillsets and project
requirements through evolutionary prototyping. Lectures and training will
include  a  comprehensive  crash  course  in  the  few  weeks  and  some
on-demand  training  (when  available) throughout the semester. Starting from
the third or fourth week of the semester, students will be required to have
frequent team meetings (at least once a week face to face) and frequent client
meetings (at least once every two weeks). Additional hands-on training, project
management training and laboratory hours will also be included.

## Grading Policies
