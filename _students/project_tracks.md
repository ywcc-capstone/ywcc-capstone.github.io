# Capstone Project Tracks
Within the Computing Capstone, there are hundreds of students across 9 different
majors. Most are in Computer Science or Information Technology programs, but we
offer many different tracks for those students who are in the other major
programs as well.

![Project Tracks as a hierarchy](/images/project_tracks.png)

## 1. Software/Hardware Projects: Industry-Sponsored Project
Put all your knowledge to the test and solve a real business problem. Work
closely with a company sponsor and build projects that deliver an impact. In
this track, you get hands-on experience in a Scrum workflow. You work in
sprints to plan, collaborate, and deliver your results.

**Team Size: 1 Project Manager + 4 Individual Contributors.**

## 2. Software/Hardware Projects: Student Startups
For the entrepreneurial and ambitious. Submit a project proposal describing
your idea and how you can solve it. Student-founded startups come up with
innovative ideas to solve a unique real-world problem. Upon approval,
teams collaborate and work to create a prototype within the semester.

**Team Size: 1 Project Manager (aka, Founder) + 3 Individual Contributors.**

## 3. Real-World Connections
Do you want to inspire the next generation of software developers and digital
creatives? In this track, you come up with your own curriculum to teach middle-
and high-school students topics such as:
* Web Development
* Game Design
* Filmmaking and Video Editing
* Digital Marketing
* and more!

**Team Size: 1 or 2 Coaches**

## 4. CISCO Academy
_Required for IT students in the Network and Information Security specialization._

The CISCO Academy is a set of courses that lead to earning the Cisco Certified
Network Association 200-301 Certificate. The primary objective of the Cisco
Project of Projects is to study for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
200-301 certificate as an independent student-led group of Information
Technology students who are the Network and Information Security specialization
through means of group study and projects. Taking the CCNA 200-301 is optional
and independent of the course or NJIT. Students will apply the knowledge they
learned into a single networking project/demonstration in groups of no more than
4 people. The independent networking project will apply all problem-solving
strategies & life cycles in the capstone industry projects and submit the same
deliverables. Ideally, students will emerge from this Capstone project with
their CCNA 200-301 and a technical networking project to add on their resume.
Combined with the degree they are soon to be finishing, students who participate
will have the upper hand when entering the workforce.

**Team Size: 1 Project Manager + 4 Individual Contributors.**

## 5. Executive Board
Making sure every student has a successful Capstone experience requires lots of
preparation and planning. The Executive Team is responsible for acting as a
point-of-contact for students and sponsors as well as orchestrating events such
as the Open House, Open University tech talks, and Project Showcases.

As a team, you are expected to:
* Plan events (book rooms, attract media, post announcements, etc.)
* Manage online communication (Canvas, Discord, and the website)
* Respond timely to questions from students, sponsors
* Mentor PMs and meet weekly to ensure progress

**Team Size: 5 Executive Board Members.**
